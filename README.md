## Welcome to the Era of Informed Skepticism ü§®

The internet is a weird place. One minute you're reading about world politics, and the next, you're in a heated debate about giraffe diets. But when it comes to news, the stakes are higher than giraffe trivia. Enter **Skeptic Reader**.

Detecting biases and logical fallacies in real-time, this plugin keeps your news as clean as your grandma‚Äôs kitchen floor.

## Features

- **Detect Logical Fallacies and Bias** ü§Ø
  - Observable bias detection on the fly
  - Logical Fallacy identification
  - Counter-argument suggestions for a well-rounded view
  - Automated logical gymnastics (no physical exercise involved)

Unravel the yarns, spin the facts, and challenge every word. In a world where headlines often scream louder than facts, Skeptic Reader is your calm, collected philosopher with a magnifying glass. Powered by GPT-4, this Chrome plugin sifts through the noise to find new questions. It‚Äôs like having a personal Socrates in your pocket, minus the awkwardness of fitting an old Greek wise man in your pocket.
